# GenerateCLLICodes

For my Summer Internship at Endeavor Communications. There are certain codes, called CLLI Codes, that are used to describe devices out in the field.
It makes the name based on the State, the County, the building, the type of device, and a number. This code will look at a text file list of all 
CLLI Codes we already have, and help guide you to make a new one so you don't copy old codes.

Not well optimized, but works well.
